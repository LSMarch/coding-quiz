## I made a quiz with html and java script!

1. When you click on the start button the timer starts and the question appears.

2. When you click on an answer you see if you are correct and move to the next question.
    * Each incorrect answer takes away time.
    * Each correct answer give you a point.

3. Once the quiz is finished you can input your initials.

4. Once you input your initials you are brought to the high score list where you'll see your name!
